SpriteModel
===========

Small c++ SFML program to help develop fake 3d models composed of layered 2d sprites such as those
seen in games like NIUM.
Development for these sprites is kind of a pain so this program is designed to allow the user to edit a 
sprite sheet in their editor of choice and view the model. Allows you to define the number of layers, width and
length of your sprite sheet.
